Dream, Dream, Dream
Dream, dream, dream,
Of places far and skies that gleam.
Dream, dream, dream,
Of rivers wide and stars that beam.

Run, run, run,
Chase the light, embrace the sun.
Run, run, run,
Until the race is fully won.

Fly, fly, fly,
Spread your wings and touch the sky.
Fly, fly, fly,
Let no fear make you shy.

Dream, dream, dream,
For dreams are where new worlds begin.
Dream, dream, dream,
And let your heart believe within.
