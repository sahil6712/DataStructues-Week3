"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, and sorry I could not travel both"
"And both that morning equally lay in leaves no step had trodden black"
"Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back"
"I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference"
