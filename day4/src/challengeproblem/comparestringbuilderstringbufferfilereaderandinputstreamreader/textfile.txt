"The Road of a Thousand Dreams"
Through the mist and through the rain,
I walk the road of dreams again.
A path unknown, yet still I stride,
With hope and fire deep inside.

The stars above, they shine so bright,
Guiding me through endless night.
Footsteps echo, soft yet strong,
A melody, a marching song.

I walk, I walk, through valleys wide,
Through mountains tall, and rivers’ tide.
Through golden fields and forests deep,
Through whispering winds that never sleep.

O, road of mine, so long, so vast,
A tale untold, a spell is cast.
With every step, with every breath,
I chase my fate, defying death.

The sun may set, the night may call,
But I shall rise, I shall not fall.
Through trials fierce, through sorrow’s test,
My heart beats bold within my chest.

The echoes call from days of old,
Stories whispered, tales retold.
A thousand voices, lost in time,
Sing their songs, their endless rhyme.

I hear them whisper in the trees,
In rustling leaves upon the breeze.
I hear them hum within the waves,
In hollow halls of silent caves.

They tell of kings, of queens, of wars,
Of sailors lost on distant shores.
Of lovers torn, of fate unkind,
Of heroes lost, of peace to find.

Yet still I walk, my path my own,
A journey carved in wood and stone.
Through joy and pain, through loss and light,
Through morning’s glow and deepest night.

The road is long, the road is wide,
Yet still my heart beats strong inside.
Through storm, through snow, through scorching heat,
I march ahead with steady feet.

Each step I take, a story grows,
A seed of hope, a tree bestows.
And though the winds may howl and fight,
I hold my torch, I keep it bright.

The rivers roar, the oceans swell,
The earth may shake, the heavens tell.
But through it all, I stand, I stay,
A wanderer upon my way.

For dreams are fire, fierce and true,
A spark within, a golden hue.
They burn, they light, they guide the soul,
They make the broken spirits whole.

So on I go, I will not yield,
Through misty moors, through flowered fields.
For though the road is long and steep,
My dreams are mine, my faith I keep.

And when the final dawn shall rise,
With golden sun in endless skies,
I’ll stand upon the mountain’s peak,
And hear the voice I longed to seek.

The road, the road, so far behind,
A tale I wrote, a path defined.
No fear, no loss, no step in vain,
For all was love, and none was pain.

So walk, O dreamer, walk with grace,
The road is yours, the world, your place.
For life’s a song, a whispered stream,
A road, a path—a thousand dreams.
